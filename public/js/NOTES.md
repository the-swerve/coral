Backbone is like a big haiku. It does so much yet says so little. Unlike Rails,
there is always many ways to do something, and the best way is sometimes
unclear or requires real knowledge of javascript.

# bindAlls
Every backbone View gets a _.bindAll called for each of its methods. This
causes the 'this' reference to always refer to the View no matter where/how the
view method is called.
